Getting Nodejs
==============


Getting Python
==============

This program uses python3 
To install python on a debian based linux machine simply run::

sudo apt-get install python3




For those rolling their own on unix-like systems (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X)
it's always helpful to use a `virtual environment
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ for your python
installation (and even easier to use with a `virtualenv-burrito
<https://github.com/brainsik/virtualenv-burrito>`_), in case you
accidentally trash something.



Getting a solver for linear optimisation
========================================

The web app is known to work with the free software GLPK and the non-free
software Gurobi (and whatever else Pyomo works with).

For Debian-based systems you can get GLPK with::

    sudo apt-get install glpk-utils

and there are similar packages for other GNU/Linux distributions.

For Windows there is `WinGLPK <http://winglpk.sourceforge.net/>`_. For
Mac OS X `brew <http://brew.sh/>`_ is your friend.


Installing the backend of the web app 
=========================

If you have the Python package installer ``pip`` wich is recommended then just run::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
On linux machines please be sure to use adminitriva rights::
	
   sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

Backend dependencies 
=====================================

PyPSA relies on the following packages which are not contained in a
standard Python installation:

* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* networkx
* pyomo
* moreitertools
* Django


Installing the front end of the web app 
=========================
