Bus,buses,"Electrically fundamental node where x-port objects attach."
Line,lines,"Lines include distribution and transmission lines, overhead lines and cables."
LineType,line_types,"Standard line types with per length values for impedances."
Link,links,"Link between two buses with controllable active power - can be used for a transport power flow model OR as a simplified version of point-to-point DC connection OR as a lossy energy converter. NB: for a lossless bi-directional HVDC or transport link, set p_min_pu = -1 and efficiency = 1. NB: It is assumed that the links neither produce nor consume reactive power."
Load,loads,"PQ power consumer."
Generator,generators,"Power generator."
